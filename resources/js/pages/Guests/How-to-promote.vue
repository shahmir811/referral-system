                You’ll agree with me that hardly you see any Nigerian that has android phone and doesn’t have Whatsapp on it. Gone are the days when people use their phones for mere chatting.

What stops you from promoting your NetContacts Nigeria Business in these Groups? You can even create your own Business group. Making 2,500 from each person that registered through you can help you solving some financial problem.
