            NetContacts is an online business where its members are paid by the people they invite to register as NetContacts member under them, through their
            <strong>"Invitation Code"(IC)</strong>. Whenever any member invites somebody to register under him/her as netcontacts member, the person registers as
            <strong>"Free Membership"</strong>. As a Free Membership you cannot invite other people to register under you until you migrate to
            <strong>"Active Membership"</strong> by paying a token of N2,500 membership activation fee to the person that invited you, before your account can become as
            <strong>Active Membership</strong>. Thereafter it’s at this point you can now also invite others and be paid too. It’s very important to know that the
            <strong>N2,500</strong> you’ll pay into the account of the person that invited is done once for life.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">Mathematically, it’s very simple:</p>
          <p
            class="lead"
          >If you refer one (1) person and you’ll get paid N2,500 and there’s no limit to number of people you can invite as active members.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>1 person = N2,500</li>
            <li>5 people = N12,500</li>
            <li>10 people = N25,000</li>
            <li>20 people = N50,000</li>
            <li>100 people = N250,000</li>
            <li>1000 people = N2,500,000....etc That's how it goes.</li>
          </ol>

            Note:- This is not a
            <strong>"Get Rich Quick"</strong> class, but a class of entrepreneur minds where only the effort of your hard work, bears seeds (reward) for you.
