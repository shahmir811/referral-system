            NetContacts is an online business where its members are paid by the people they invite to register as NetContacts member under them, through their
            <strong>"Invitation Code"(IC)</strong>. Whenever any member invites somebody to register under him/her as netcontacts member, the person registers as
            <strong>"Free Membership"</strong>. As a Free Membership you cannot invite other people to register under you until you migrate to
            <strong>"Active Membership"</strong> by paying a token of N2,500 membership activation fee to the person that invited you, before your account can become as
            <strong>Active Membership</strong>. Thereafter it’s at this point you can now also invite others and be paid too. It’s very important to know that the
            <strong>N2,500</strong> you’ll pay into the account of the person that invited is done once for life.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">Mathematically, it’s very simple:</p>
          <p
            class="lead"
          >If you refer one (1) person and you’ll get paid N2,500 and there’s no limit to number of people you can invite as active members.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>1 person = N2,500</li>
            <li>5 people = N12,500</li>
            <li>10 people = N25,000</li>
            <li>20 people = N50,000</li>
            <li>100 people = N250,000</li>
            <li>1000 people = N2,500,000....etc That's how it goes.</li>
          </ol>

            Note:- This is not a
            <strong>"Get Rich Quick"</strong> class, but a class of entrepreneur minds where only the effort of your hard work, bears seeds (reward) for you.

            <strong>STEP 1:</strong> Log on to http://www.netcontacts.com.ng
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            <strong>STEP 2:</strong> Click on "Get Started Now" and register on the platform with your personal information and account details. You would be asked for your Invitation Code, kindly input the invitation code of the person that invited you (This is very important otherwise your account wouldn’t be ACTIVATED for you to start making money).
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            <strong>STEP 3:</strong> After you put the invitation code for example 123456789 and registration shows successfully, the next step is to check your Dashboard you will see ACTIVATE MY ACCOUNT, once clicked you’ll view your referral ( i.e the person that invited you)
            <strong>Bank Account Details</strong> for payment.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            <strong>STEP 4:</strong> This is the stage you make payment of #2,500 to your referral account as shown on your Dashboard. However, we’ll advise you first contact your referral for immediate activation once payment is confirmed. What this means is that only the person that you registered with through his/her
            <strong>Referral link or Invitation Code</strong> can activate your account.
          </p>

            <strong>ACTIVE MEMBER</strong> and you can now start inviting as many people as you like using your
            <strong>Referral link or Invitation Code</strong>. There’s no limit on the people you can invite. The more people you invite to join NetContacts, the more you smile to the bank. Isn’t that great? Yes of course!
