              <strong>What’s NetContacts Nigeria and How do I make Money from it?</strong>
            </li>
            <p>Netcontacts Nigeria is an Online empowerment Business that allows you to earn money online from the comfort of your bedroom. The method is very simple, <strong>if you invite me, I pay you; if I invite other people, they pay me.</strong> The process is sowing and reaping. What you sow (‎<strong>₦2,500</strong>) you reap in unlimited folds (From as many people as you invite to become Active Members paying ‎<strong>₦2,500</strong> to your Bank Account directly).</p>

            <li>
              <strong>What is this ‎₦2,500 for?</strong>
            </li>
            <p>The ‎₦2,500 you pay is just for your membership activation, thereby migrating you from <strong>Free Membership to Active or Paid Membership.</strong> Please Note: You’re only allowed to pay this amount into the account of the person that invited you which you’ll only get to see on your Membership Dashboard. </p>
